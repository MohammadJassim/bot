* This is the README for the robot program

- Currently the code has issues running from main. These need to be fixed for the program to work correctly.
- The surface of the table is created from the surface.rb code. Currently the surface is drawn using print() but this needs to be changed
- The input command is validated by the validator.rb class.
- The robot is created and moved using the robot.rb class
- The test.rb class contains what is working and tested so far. The program, however, needs to work correctly from main.rb and the issues need to be fixed

* To run the program:
- 1. clone the repo locally using `git clone git@github.com:MohammadJassim/bot`
- 2. go to the program directory `cd bot` 
- 3. exec command `ruby main.rb`

* To run the test porgram
- 4. exec command `ruby test.rb`
